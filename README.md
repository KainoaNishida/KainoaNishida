<h3 align="left">My name is Kainoa Nishida</h3>

I am a first year university student pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Engineering. Though I may be young, don't understimate my devleopmental skills ðŸ˜‰. I am currently a devloper for [Commit the Change][committhechange], meaning I work on the backend of projects to distribute to local non-profit organizations. I am currently working on creating a database in SQL to document the endangered Pismo Clam species in the Newport and Laguna area.

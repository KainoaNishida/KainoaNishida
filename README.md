<h3 align="left">Aloha!! My name is Kainoa Nishida</h3>

I am a first year university student pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Engineering. Though I may be young, don't understimate my devleopmental skills 😉. I am currently a devloper for [Commit the Change][committhechange], meaning I work on the backend of projects to distribute to local non-profit organizations. I am currently working on creating a database in SQL to document the endangered Pismo Clam species in the Newport and Laguna area.

On my free time, I love to watch anime, workout, make coffee and try out new things!
